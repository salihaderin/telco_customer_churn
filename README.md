# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

It contains information about customers of a telecom company, including services used, customer account information, and whether they left the company or not.

## Current Status
ðŸš€ Repository just created â€” data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training will be added step by step.
